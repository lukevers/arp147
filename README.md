> Arp 147 (also known as IC 298) is an interacting pair of [ring galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_galaxies). It lies 430 million to 440 million light years away in the constellation [Cetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus) and does not appear to be part of any significant [galaxy group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group). The system was originally discovered in 1893 by [Stephane Javelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephane_Javelle) and is listed in the [Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_Peculiar_Galaxies).

# Gameplay

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

I'm just having fun. Feel free to make suggestions. I'll update this once there's any actual gameplay mechanics. See [TODO](TODO.md) for more information.

# Development

Arp 147 is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) with the [GB](https://getgb.io/) build tool. Code generation by [genny](https://github.com/cheekybits/genny). All code written in Go should be formatted properly.

## Building

```bash
gb generate
gb build all
```
