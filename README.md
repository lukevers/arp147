> Arp 147 (also known as IC 298) is an interacting pair of [ring galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_galaxies). It lies 430 million to 440 million light years away in the constellation [Cetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetus) and does not appear to be part of any significant [galaxy group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group). The system was originally discovered in 1893 by [Stephane Javelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephane_Javelle) and is listed in the [Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_Peculiar_Galaxies).

# Gameplay

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

I'm just having fun. Feel free to make suggestions. I'll update this once there's any actual gameplay mechanics. See [TODO](TODO.md) for more information.

## Time / Clock

The game starts out on `1 January, 6000 at 00:00`. A minute of game time is about a second in real life.

# Development

Arp 147 is written in [Go](https://golang.org/), using [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep/) for dependency management. All code written in Go should be properly formatted and linted.

## Building

```bash
dep ensure
go build
```
