# Engo
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/EngoEngine/engo](https://badges.gitter.im/EngoEngine/engo.svg)](https://gitter.im/EngoEngine/engo?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A cross-platform game engine written in Go following an interpretation of the Entity Component System paradigm. Engo is
 currently compilable for Mac OSX, Linux and Windows. With the release of Go 1.4, sporting Android and the inception of 
 iOS compatibility, mobile will [soon](https://github.com/engoengine/engo/issues/63) be added as a release target. Web 
 support  ([gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs)) is also [planned](https://github.com/engoengine/engo/issues/71). 

Currently documentation is pretty scarce, this is because we have not *completely* finalized the API and are about to 
go through a "prettification" process in order to increase elegance and usability. For a basic up-to-date example of 
most features, look at the demos.

## Getting in touch / Contributing

We have a [gitter](https://gitter.im/EngoEngine/engo) chat for people to join who want to further discuss `engo`. We are happy to discuss bugs, feature requests and would love to hear about the projects you are building!
