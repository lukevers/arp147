# Falling Demo

## What does it do?
It demonstrates how one can create a game with gravity-ish components.  

For doing so, it created a lot of rocks that move downards.   

## What are important aspects of the code?
These things are key in this demo:

* The `ControlSystem`, to move the user around, to avoid the rocks;
* The `RockSpawnSystem`, to keep spawning the rocks;
* The `FallingSystem`, to make the rocks fall;
* The `DeathSystem`, to make sure you'd want to avoid the rocks.
