# Hello Demo

## What does it do?
It demonstrates how one can manipulate the scale, by using a very simple custom `System`. 

For doing so, it created an `Entity`, that is scaled up/down to show it's actually doing something.  

## What are important aspects of the code?
These things are key in this demo:

* The code that generates the `guy`, within `Setup()`;
* The code within `ScaleSystem.Update()` that actually does the manipulation.
